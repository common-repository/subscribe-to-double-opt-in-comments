== Upgrade Notice ==

Currently none.

== Description ==

Allows readers to receive notifications of new comments that are posted to an entry, after they successfully used the mandatory double-opt-in process to verify their e-mail address. 
First, the user will get an e-mail with a confirmation link, after the user has confirmed the subscription, he or she will be noticed about new comments. This reduces junk and other unwanted e-mail communication.
This plugin is based on Mark JaquithÂ´s "Subscribe to Comments" plugin. More information on my blog: <a href="https://sjmp.de/internet/subscribe-to-comments-mit-double-opt-in-pruefung/">sjmp.de</a>.

== Installation ==

The most used way is to use the WordPress plugin installation process in your admin panel. Just search for the plugin name and click "Install". After that, you can configure the plugin within its settings page.

Another, manual, way would be:

1. Upload all files to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in your WordPress admin panel
3. Set settings via "Settings" menu in WordPress
4. Ready, steady, go :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I need to know regarding the GDPR / DSGVO? =

This plugin stores the following information additionally to the regular WordPress comment data:
- flag if the user has received a doube-opt-in e-mail,
- flag if the user successfully subscribed,
- anonymous hash to identify the double-opt-in e-mail.

This plugin also uses cookies to:
- check if the user has commented on a blog post with a specific e-mail address (Name: comment_author_email_<random_hash>, Lifespan: stored for 1 year),
- check if the user has checked or unchecked the double-opt-in checkbox for a blog post (Name: subscribe_checkbox_<random_hash>, Lifespan: stored for 1 year),
- optionally if used, check whether the feature "subscribe to a blog post without commenting" was used by the user (Name: comment_withoutCommentToken_<random_hash>, Lifespan: stored for 3 days).

Hint: WordPress, by itself, stores the IP address of the user commenting! You have to ensure that this personal information is handled according to the law of your country!

= How can I change the place of the subscription checkbox? =

Use this code (within the loop) in your template file, to change the place of the checkbox: <code><?php show_subscription_checkbox(); ?></code>

= Can people subscribe manually without commenting? =

Yes, just place this code snippet in your template (outside the comments form): <code><?php show_manual_subscription_form(); ?></code>

= I use Hosteurope.de as my website hoster and I cannot send e-mails via this plugin =

See this (german) comment for a solution: <a href="http://www.sjmp.de/internet/subscribe-to-comments-mit-double-opt-in-pruefung/comment-page-10/#comment-4460">Go to Comment</a>

== Screenshots ==

1. Part of the settings menu.
2. The checkbox to subscribe to a comment thread.
